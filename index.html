          <p> Parrots are my favorite animal. I love how human-like they are in relation to their copycat speech skill. I also wish to own one as a pet when I am older.</p>

           <p> This picture represents my love for baking. I started baking during covid because I had nothing else to do, but now I love baking for me and my family. I only wish to keep baking new and different desserts in the future.
