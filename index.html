        <p> First off, I have never been to Hawaii, but like most people I wouldn't mind visiting a hot tropical island. I love to interact with wildlife and in Hawaii there is tons of wildlife that I can interact with. I would also love to try the traditional food they serve in Hawaii, I love trying new foods so getting to try the tasty food they serve would be a dream.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2> FOOD !</h2>
          <p> <strong>Food:</strong> I love trying new foods and Hawaii provides a unique blend of fresh ingredients and diverse cultural influences, including native Hawaiian, Asian, and American flavors. Dishes like poke, loco moco, and kalua pig showcase the islands' rich culinary traditions. It's a flavorful experience that reflects Hawaii's history and local culture.</p>
